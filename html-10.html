                <dt>Fresh ginger tea</dt>
                <dd>Warming, spicy ginger tea has a long history of use for stomach ache and nausea. To make it fresh,
                    grate or slice a small piece of peeled ginger root. Pour boiled water over it and leave to brew for
                    around 10 minutes. Alternatively, you can buy teabags in most supermarkets.</dd>
                <dt>Fruit tea</dt>
                <dd>If you fancy something fruity, flavoursome fruit tea is a good low-calorie option. There are dozens
                    of different teabags and loose tea blends available. Check the labels and choose one that doesn’t
                    contain sugar. And avoid teas that contain liquorice, which can increase your blood pressure.</dd>
                <dt>Fresh mint tea</dt>
                <dd>Mint tea is low in calories, a great palate cleanser and has traditionally been used to aid
                    digestion. Wash and tear up a handful of mint leaves, add to a small teapot and top up with boiling
                    water. Avoid Moroccan mint tea in restaurants, as it can be loaded with sugar.</dd>
                <dt>Hot chocolate</dt>
                <dd>A small hot chocolate from a high street coffee shop can contain nearly five teaspoons (20g) of
                    sugar. These extra calories can cause weight gain, increasing your risk of heart disease. If it’s
                    made with full-fat milk and topped with whipped cream, this will add more calories, and it will be
                    high in saturated fat, which could affect your cholesterol levels. For a heart-healthy version, mix
                    unsweetened cocoa powder with hot low-fat milk and low-calorie sweetener, if needed.</dd>

                <dt>Pepsi</dt>
                <dd>Pepsi is undoubtedly one of the best selling cold drinks in India. It was launched for the Indian
                    market in 1990. The brand has changed its name from Brad’s drink to Pepsi Cola to Pepsi.</dd>
                <dt>CocaCola</dt>
                <dd>When it comes to the cold drink industry, Coca Cola has been dominating the market since forever.
                    Ever since its creation in 1888 by John Pemberton, the company has been using a secret recipe for
                    getting its unique flavor.</dd>
                <dt>Sprite</dt>
                <dd>This lemony tasted and sparkly cold drink has won the hearts of many Indians. The drink is perfect
                    for after heavy meals. No matter the time of the day, you can use a chilled glass of sprite for
                    quenching your thirst.</dd>
                <dt>Thums Up</dt>
                <dd>This cold drink is similar in color to Coca Cola and Pepsi. However, it has a slightly different
                    taste. This is a home-grown brand that was introduced by the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)
                    company in India.</dd>
